# 3. Tokenomics Will Become More Important in Society, Regulation Follows Slowly

Tokens will become an essential tool for the organisation of tomorrow. In fact, tokens will be the fuel of the decentralised economy. They will define our future society thanks to their unique characteristics. First of all, tokens are programmable. This means that certain features or rules can be embedded in the token. These rules could be related to dividend release (the longer you hold a token, the more dividend you will get), voting rights (the longer and the more tokens you have, the more voting rights you will get) or other privileges. These rules can then become an effective way to incentivise ownership and ensure price stability.

A second significant benefit of tokens will be that it will result in an explosion of liquidity in the world economy. Security tokens are tokens that allow the owner of that token a (future) stake in a company or asset such as a painting, a car or a building, whether it be in the form of dividends, revenue share, or a price appreciation.

As a consequence, fractional ownership becomes possible, whereby a few or thousands of people can own an asset. The result is that all of a sudden, illiquid assets such as buildings or paintings become highly liquid, as the token representing the asset can be exchanged and settled instantly on a secondary market. When investors ‘discover’ the potential of security tokens, trillions of dollars of illiquid assets will become highly liquid, thereby having a profound impact on the world economy.

In 2019, we saw the first secondary markets open for the public. Exchanges for security tokens such as tZero, OpenFinance or the Malta Security Token Exchange will drive the adoption of (security) tokens in 2020. The more security tokens that become available, the more important tokenomics (or token economics) will become. Tokenomics is the study of how tokens work in the broader economic ecosystem. One reason why regulators responded so hard to the launch of Libra was that Libra has the potential to disrupt the current monetary and economic system altogether. Obviously, governments, central bankers and regulators are not too happy about that. However, tokens are here to stay, and tokenomics will increase in importance and regulators will have to scramble to catch up.

The challenge with token regulation, however, is that borders or local regulations do not stop tokens. By definition, tokens are global and, hence, regulation should be global. Unfortunately, in today's world, such regulations are still very far off. Many regulators are still struggling to understand blockchain, let alone tokenomics and the impact of tokens on the world economy.

In 2020, we will see a drastic increase in security token offerings. We will see an increase in the tokenisation of illiquid assets and regulators and lawmakers will slowly adapt to the new world. Some countries will create regulation that will stifle innovation, while others will create regulation that embraces the new situation. Those countries with favourable, and clear rules will win the battle for startups and reap the benefits of increasing economic activities.
