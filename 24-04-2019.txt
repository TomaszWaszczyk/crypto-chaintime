REASON 1

Analysts predict an upsurge in BTC price

The bitcoin price could hit $23,500 in 2019 — says Samson Mow, CSO of Blockstream. Tim Draper, a famous crypto enthusiast & billionaire, goes even further, stating that BTC is to break through $50,000 mark this year. They are echoed by tens and hundreds of smaller-caliber analysts. Not that we're calling you to blindly believe their words. But think about this: during the bitcoin history, its price has increased by 8 million (!) times. Why should we believe it'll stop suddenly?

REASON 2

Uprising trend is at its very beginning

While the tendency to increase is not to doubt, lots of miners and crypto investors are still not aware of it — or just hesitating. That is your chance to join the game before the crowds rush to mine and buy BTC at a low price. Outdo indecisive ones and hit the jackpot, be smart, quick and bold — catch the moment!
